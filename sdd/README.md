SDD (Shame Driven Development)
==============================

This is a new learning model we're trying out where we pair developers and write test suites for each other. Our counterpart then writes code to pass that test suite. There are no other rules. The intention is to engage in TDD with someone holding you accountable to deliver both the test suite and passing code for the tests you've created.
