KNN Solution
============

**Stop here if you don't want to see any spoilers!**

I implement KNN using a package that builds a k-d tree. This allows for efficient nearest neighbor searches. Use of this package makes sample setup a little more involved as it needs to implement an interface from the kdtree package. It's not necessary to use a k-d tree for knn, but it makes it more efficient.
